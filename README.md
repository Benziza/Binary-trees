# Binary-trees

## 1-Definition

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures, and a binary tree is a data tree in which each node has a maximum of two child nodes, which are called the right son and the left son.

The top node in the data tree is called the root, the elements that branch from one element are called children, the element above another element is called the parent element, and the elements that do not have children are called leaves.

## 2-Applications that use data trees

Data trees are used to store information in a hierarchical fashion, like a computer's file system.
There are other applications of data trees, including:<br>
1-Data trees (with some arrangement like binary data trees) allow medium-speed accesses and searches (faster than linked lists and slower than arrays).<br>
2-Data trees allow medium-speed insertions and deletions (faster than arrays and slower than unordered linked lists).<br>
3-B-Tree and B+ Tree are used to perform indexing in databases.<br>

## 3-Binary data tree

### 3-1-Definition

A tree in which each element has at most two sons is called a Binary Tree, and since each element has only two sons, it can be called the right son and the left son.
